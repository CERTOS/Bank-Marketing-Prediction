##  TASK TO PERFORM
Read in the file and get basic information about the data, including numerical summaries.
- Describe the pdays column, make note of the mean, median and minimum values. Anything fishy in the values?
- Describe the pdays column again, this time limiting yourself to the relevant values of pdays. How different are the mean and the median values?
- Plot a horizontal bar graph with the median values of balance for each education level value. Which group has the highest median?
- Make a box plot for pdays. Do you see any outliers?

The final goal is to make a predictive model to predict if the customer will respond positively to the campaign or not. The target variable is “response”.
Perform bi-variate analysis to identify the features that are directly associated with the target variable and EDA is performed. 

## After necessary EDA performed two models are made:
### Predictive model 1: Logistic regression
### Predictive model 2: Random Forest

And then both the model is compared accourding to their accuracy and concluded which algorithm is better.
